    <h1>Cyberpunk 2077:</h1>
    <p class="Cyberpunk">
        is a new game from the Polish game developer "CD Projekt Red". <br>
        The game was released in 10/12/2020, and after 8 years of waiting and anticipation for the game to release, although fans seem to be disappointed... <br>
        The main reason of fan's disappointment is the major bugs in the previews generation consoles, the PS4 and the XBOX One. <br>
        Currently the company assesses the damage caused to her by the miscalculation of their game's instability and promises to release two massive patches <br>
        on January and February that are suppose to fix most if not all of the major issues with the game's performance. <br>
        But as of now only time will tell if CD Projekt Red have what it takes to turn this around for the better or not.
